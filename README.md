### Prototype UI Design Description

The user interface design is meant to be simple but also include all of the essential information the user would need to know when stumbling upon the homepage. On the upper left-hand corner is the logo of the app, GenMeet, which is big enough for the user to also recognize it as a button to bring them back to the homepage if they were on any other page in the app. The app's motto, "BRIDGE THE GAP", is displayed in a large and bold font to emphasize the main purpose of the app. Below the motto is a description of why the app exists and how it benefits the user, with a few highlights to emphasize the important parts of the description. Right below is a bold yellow button labelled "GET STARTED", which hopefully prompts the user to begin making their profile in the app. Finally, on the far left is an illustration of a staircase between two pathways. The staircase "bridges the gap" between the two paths, bringing back the motif of the motto.
